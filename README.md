# Analyzing International Debt Statistics
In this project, I was able to track the top countries with the highest amount of debt, rank the countries based on their respective debt amount, as well as query the one country with the lowest principal repayment amount. This experience allowed me to showcase and refine my SQL knowledge and implementation by answering questions that require precision.
